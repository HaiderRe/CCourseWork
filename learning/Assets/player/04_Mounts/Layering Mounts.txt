The sprites are named: Category_Animation_Metal_Piece_#
Here is an example: Mount_Idle_Copper_Chest_1

HOW TO LAYER THE SPRITES

The number at the end of the name implies the design of armor, for instance... Mount_Idle_Copper_Chest_1 is different than Mount_Idle_Copper_Chest_2.

All the sprites that end in A should go above the helmet.

The Mounts should be layered in this manner:

MOST TOP LAYER---------
MOUNT ending in A
ARMOR ending in A
HELMET
HAIR
ARMOR
GLOVES
BASE
MOUNT ending in B
MOST BOTTOM LAYER------

One important thing to note is that if you are wearing a helmet you should disable the hair layer.
