The sprites are named: Weapon_Animation_Name_#
Here is an example: Weapon_Idle_OldSword_1

HOW TO LAYER THE SPRITES

All the sprites that end in 1 should go above the gloves and below the helmet and armor.

All the sprites that end in 2 should go above everything.

The weapons should be layered in this manner:

MOST TOP LAYER---------
ENDING IN 2
HELMET
ARMOR
ENDING IN 1
GLOVES
PANTS
SHOES
HAIR
BODY
MOST BOTTOM LAYER------
