The sprites are named: Weapon_Animation_Metal_Piece_#
Here is an example: Base_Idle_Copper_Chest_1

HOW TO LAYER THE SPRITES

The number at the end of the name implies the design of armor, for instance... Base_Idle_Copper_Chest_1 is different than Base_Idle_Copper_Chest_2.

All the sprites that end in A should go above the helmet.

The armor should be layered in this manner:

MOST TOP LAYER---------
ARMOR ending in A
HELMET
ARMOR
GLOVES
PANTS
SHOES
HAIR
BODY
MOST BOTTOM LAYER------

One important thing to note is that if you are wearing a helmet you should disable the hair layer.
