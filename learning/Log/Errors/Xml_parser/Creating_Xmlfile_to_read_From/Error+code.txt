Ran into an error with intlisating my xml file, it gave an error. As the error both referenced RapidXML and characters, while I was trying to input a string as the filename of the Xml file. I looked at RapidXML's manual, and found out that instead of entering in a string I had to enter an array of characters as a parameter, thus I used the .c_str() method on the path string to convert it to an array of characters.
